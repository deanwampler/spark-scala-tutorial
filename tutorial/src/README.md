# README for tutorial/src

Activator requires HTML tutorials with a particular format, which Markdown to HTML tools can't support. So, the original text is maintained here in `index.md`, used to generate the HTML file in the `tutorial` directory, and then the HTML is hand edited as required.

Specifically, all the `<h2>` sections are wrapped in `<div>...</div>` tags.
