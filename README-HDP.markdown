This workshop demonstrates how to write and run [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) *Big Data* applications within a special, extended version of the Hortonworks Sandbox, version 2.1. This version was extended by Hortonworks and Typesafe to add the [Spark 1.1](https://spark.apache.org) distribution and the [Typesafe Reactive Platform](https://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted), including an *Activator* template called [Spark Workshop](https://typesafe.com/activator/template/spark-workshop). You are reading the introduction to this workshop.

Run the script `./start.sh` to launch the [Activator](http://typesafe.com/activator) environment with its web UI. It will echo a message with the URL to view it. The UI will show the tutorial for this project and allow you to browse the code and run the examples.
